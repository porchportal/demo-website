  "subtitle": "A Framework for Enhanced Data Interpretation using AI Super-Resolution",
  "description": "The Attention Dot Visualization in Eye-Tracking project introduces an AI-enhanced framework that integrates Real-ESRGAN Super-Resolution with gaze estimation to accurately detect and visualize where users look on the screen using only standard 1080p cameras. By upscaling input images by 4Ã— times scale, the system restores fine eye details critical for prediction, enabling regression models (Linear, Ridge, SVR, Bayesian Ridge, ARD) to achieve superior accuracy (RÂ² > 0.73, MAPE ~52â€“62) compared to the baseline (RÂ² ~0.34, MAPE >113). This advancement demonstrates that AI-driven super-resolution significantly improves eye-tracking precision while remaining cost-effective, providing a powerful solution for marketing analytics, UI/UX optimization, and real-time attention mapping without the need for specialized hardware.",

    "content": "This project successfully integrates AI Super-Resolution (Real-ESRGAN) into the eye-tracking process to dramatically improve the predictive accuracy of where a user is looking, using only standard 1080p camera input. By upscaling the resolution by 4x, we confirmed a significant performance jump, with test RÂ² reaching over 0.73 compared to a â‰ˆ 0.34 baseline. This approach offers a cost-effective and high-accuracy solution, making advanced attention mapping accessible for wide-scale marketing and UI/UX optimization without specialized hardware."
